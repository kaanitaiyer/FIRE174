        <note>In this article, Saidiya Hartman theorizes archival violence and its disproportionate impact on the lives of Black women. Hartman argues that archival traces and texts corroborate representations of Black women as always dead or dying, if not in relentless peril. Such violence dehumanizes Black women, not just in the historical record, but also in contemporary life. This theorizing of archival violence contributes to this digital surrogate insofar as every attempt has been made to recognize and amplify the human activities and accomplishments of Black women, with particular attention paid to their life experiences beyond suffering and pain.</note>

          <note>Since this collection aims to gather journalistic work, many publications use the Associated Press Style to standardize their work. The AP Style focuses not only on grammar but format and synxtax. It is important to recognize this as a language because often times journalistic work can appear more rigid and choppy than spoken word or other writing and that is because of AP Style. For example, it eliminates the word "on" and abbrevaites states, address, and dates, just to name a few</note>

      <p>After <persName>DeAndre Harris</persName> was brutally beaten by <choice><corr>white</corr><sic>White</sic></choice> nationalists in <placeName><settlement>Charlottesville</settlement>, <region><abbr>VA<corr>Va.</corr></abbr></region></placeName>, last summer, police charged the 20-year-old <choice><corr>black</corr><sic>Black</sic></choice> man with assaulting the nationalists. Eventually he was acquitted, but this has become a pattern: Law<corr>law</corr> enforcement underreporting hate crimes in America, while tacitly colluding with perpetuators by charging the victims. The impact is that those who would protest against <choice><corr>white</corr><sic>White</sic></choice> supremacists often become intimidated.</p>
      <note>The abbreviation of Virginia was changed to reflect AP Style.</note>
      <p>Two summers ago, this “charge the victim” tactic got personal when I was speared with a flagpole by a Neo-Nazi at a <choice><corr>white</corr><sic>White</sic></choice>-supremacist rally. On that Sunday morning at least 10 people were injured on the grounds of the state capitol in <placeName><settlement>Sacramento</settlement>, <region><abbr>CA<corr>Calif.</corr></abbr></region></placeName> The <orgName>California Highway Patrol</orgName><abbr>(CHP)</abbr>, which approved the permit for the rally in the first place, later expressed sympathy for the <choice><corr>white</corr><sic>White</sic></choice> supremacists and targeted “anti-racist” demonstrators,” which was documented in <orgName>the Guardian</orgName>.</p>
      <p>After my attack, police illegally entered my hospital room as I recovered from surgery and slept under anesthesia. Without a search warrant, they stole my video camera and left a note saying they took it. My footage contained evidence of the neo-Nazi who speared me, but by the time the camera was returned that had been destroyed. The same investigators used a familiar justification stating, “I could see how [the neo-Nazis] might feel threatened.” This is the same justification that has allowed police to walk free after killing countless unarmed Black people across the country.</p>
      <p>After the rally in <placeName><settlement>Sacramento</settlement></placeName>, the <abbr>CHP</abbr> recommended that 100 people involved in the brawl, including myself, be charged. That led to 68 of us facing felonies, and 514 misdemeanors. Ultimately, prosecutors declined to bring charges in all but four cases due to insufficient evidence. A hearing for William Planer, the only Nazi sympathizer charged, had his trial set for <date>July 31</date>, while the anti-fascist trio, “the Sacramento 3,” go to court on <date>October 12</date>.</p>
      <p>Law enforcement’s refusal to investigate racist-hate crimes and choice to “charge the victim” is a hate crime in itself.</p>
