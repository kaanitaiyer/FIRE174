<h4 align="center"><i>Restructuring the Face of Crime</i></h4>

<hr>

<p>News stories focusing on Black people tends to perpetuate the historical silencing of positive Black narratives through its criminalization of the community. However, in recent years, the Black community has been able to have a strong and positive voice on digital spaces, especially Twitter, which also has been incredibly influential in the dissemination of news; thus, allowing direct resistance of the narrative. This digital archive aims to contribute to the larger conversation of redefining Black freedom as it shows the Black community challenging and correcting the single-story narrative to escape the stereotypical criminality that confines them. </p>
