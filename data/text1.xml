         <p>I treat young people committing offenses very seriously - and I don't believe in the death penalty, but it is heartbreaking to always see how the media treats and resonds to young <choice><sic>black</sic><corr>Black</corr></choice> people even as victims.</p>
       <div type="reply">
         <p><seg type="Black-victims">In the eyes of mainstream media, there is no such thing as a <choice><sic>black</sic><corr>Black</corr></choice> victim.</seg> Not <persName ref="https://www.theroot.com/remember-trayvon-1792723981">Trayvon Martin</persName>, not <persName ref="https://www.theroot.com/jordan-davis-parents-react-to-mistrial-in-son-s-killin-1790874601">Jordan Davis</persName>, not <persName ref="https://www.theroot.com/detroit-cop-who-killed-7-year-old-will-face-only-misdem-1790877317">Aiyana Stanley-Jones</persName>, not even <persName>Tamir Rice</persName>. <seg type="criminality">To many <choice><sic>blackness</sic><corr>Blackness</corr></choice> means perpetrator.</seg></p> <!-- I assigned the Black victims and criminality segments because one of the reoccuring disucssions we had this semester is Black freedom and that is often compromised due to incarceration, which goes hand in hand with criminality. Furthermore, the struggles of Black people, especially when they are the victims, are discredited due to the criminality stereotype assigned to the community. The mainstream, White narrative recognizes the crime and wrongdoings of the Black community but never when they are on the receiving end of crime. -->
       <div type="reply">
         <p>While I recognize many may not appreciate this comparison, I find it to be an important one. Why? Because <seg type="White-narrative">we have to call out the anti-<choice><sic>black</sic><corr>Black</corr></choice> racism pervasive in mainstream media and its reporting.</seg></p> <!-- I segmented White narrative because African-American discourse is often presented by a White narrative as that is what society recognizes due to it being so mainstream. Since the narrative is written predominatly by White people, it does not applify Black voices nor does it correctly portray Black stories.-->
       <div type="reply">
         <p>And for those wondering, "<choice><sic>is</sic><corr>Is</corr></choice> this really about racism and anti-<choice><sic>blackness</sic><corr>Blackness</corr></choice> when <forename>Nikolas</forename>' last name is "<surname>Cruz</surname>."<corr>"</corr> Yes. And that question also means that you fail to realize that <choice><sic>whiteness</sic><corr>Whiteness</corr></choice> doesn't operate within a vacuum.</p>
       <div type="reply">
         <p>Let's remember how the media treats young <choice><sic>black</sic><corr>Black</corr></choice> people: <seg type="criminality"><persName ref="https://www.theroot.com/everything-you-think-you-know-about-the-death-of-mike-b-1793261221">Mike Brown</persName> was a teenager referred to as a "man" to make him older than his age indicated.</seg> He was shot as he was leaving. That didn't stop media from referring to him as a thug who deserved to die.</p>
       <div type="reply">
         <p><persName ref="https://www.theroot.com/on-philando-castile-terror-and-the-trauma-that-remains-1796311248">Philando Castile</persName> may not have been as young as <persName>Tamir Rice</persName> or <persName>Mike Brown</persName>, but had a licenced weapon and was still gunned down in front of his girlfriend and daughter. This was filmed live. The terroristic NRA basically said "we need to investigate further." See: racism.</p>
       <div type="reply">
         <p><persName ref="https://www.theroot.com/tag/korryn-gaines">Korryn Gaines</persName> was killed in <settlement>Baltimore</settlement>, <region>Md.</region> even though she was holding her son. <seg type="criminality">To this day, people still blame her for her own death despite police being trained in de-escalation.</seg> They didn't care for her (or her son's life). Because: Black woman.</p>
       <div type="reply">
         <p>Remember <persName>Jordan Davis</persName>? He was killed because <persName>Michael Dunn</persName>, an older <choice><sic>white</sic><corr>White</corr></choice> man, didn't like how loud his music was. He killed him and went back home to eat pizza. This was also in <region>Florida</region>. That older man said he was he was intimatted and that <surname>Davis</surname> had a gun.</p>
         <p>Spoiler: he did not.</p>
       <div type="reply">
         <p>Point is: <seg type="criminality">young <choice><sic>black</sic><corr>Black</corr></choice> people are not given the chance to be victims or survivors; only perpetrators of violence.</seg> <seg type="White-narrative">This is played out (and defended) in the media who only exacerbate this dangerous narrative.</seg> It must stop.</p> <!-- I chose to capitalize Black and Blackness because I believe it is a proper adjective and the Black community has been historically disrespected and discredited; therefore I believe the capitalization shows that they are humans and deserve the respect that is not given in mainstream narrative.

         <p>So, yes, <g>@</g><orgName>CNN</orgName>, <g>@</g><orgName>MSNBC</orgName>, <g>@</g><orgName>democracynow</orgName>, <g>@</g><orgName>FoxNews</orgName> (not that we expect much for you, in particular), it is incumbent to offer perspectives that will uplift the most marginalized.</p>
